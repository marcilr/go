  Uninstalle this one.

=====
Command goimports updates your Go import lines,
adding missing ones and removing unreferenced ones.

Command vet
Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious
constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do
not align with the format string.  Vet uses heuristics
that do not guarantee all reports are genuine problems,
but it can find errors not caught by the compilers.
