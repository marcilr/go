godebug uses source code generation to instrument your program with debugging
calls.  go tool cover takes a similar approach to code coverage. When you run
godebug, it parses your program, instruments function calls, variable
declarations, and statement lines, outputs the resulting code somewhere, and
runs/compiles it.  When this modified code runs, it stops at breakpoints and
lets you step through the program and inspect variables.
