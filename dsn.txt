DSN (Data Source Name)


The Data Source Name has a common format,..., but without type-prefix
(optional parts marked by squared brackets):
    [username[:password]@][protocol[(address)]]/\
    dbname[?param1=value1&...&paramN=valueN]

A DSN in its fullest form:
    username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value

Except for the databasename, all values are optional. So the minimal DSN is:
    /dbname

If you do not want to preselect a database, leave dbname empty:
    /

This has the same effect as an empty DSN string:


Alternatively, Config.FormatDSN[1] can be used to create a DSN string
by filling a struct.
