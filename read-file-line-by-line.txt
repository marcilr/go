Instead of using a Scanner, use a bufio.Reader, specifically the ReadBytes
or ReadString methods.  This way you can read up to each line termination,
and still receive the full line with line endings.

  r := bufio.NewReader(inputFile)

  var line []byte
  fPos := 0 // or saved position

  for i := 1; ; i++ {
      line, err = r.ReadBytes('\n')
      fmt.Printf("[line:%d pos:%d] %q\n", i, fPos, line)

      if err != nil {
          break
      }
      fPos += len(line)
  }

  if err != io.EOF {
      log.Fatal(err)
  }

You can store the combination of file position and line number however you
choose, and the next time you start, you use inputFile.Seek(fPos, os.SEEK_SET)
to move to where you left off.
