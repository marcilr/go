List installed packages


Listing Packages
================
To list packages in your workspace, go to your workspace folder and run this
command:

    go list ./...

./ tells to start from the current folder, ... tells to go down recursively.
Of course this works in any other folders not just in your go workspace (but
usually that is what you're interested in).


List All Packages
=================
Executing

    go list ...

in any folder lists all the packages, including packages of the standard
library first followed by external libraries in your go workspace.


Packages and their Dependencies
===============================
If you also want to see the imported packages by each package, you can try
this custom format:

    go list -f "{{.ImportPath}} {{.Imports}}" ./...

-f specifies an alternate format for the list, using the syntax of package
template.  The struct whose fields can be referenced can be printed by the go
help list command.

If you want to see all the dependencies recursively (dependencies of imported
packages recursively), you can use this custom format:

    go list -f "{{.ImportPath}} {{.Deps}}" ./...

But usually this is a long list and just the single imports ("{{.Imports}}")
of each package is what you want.
