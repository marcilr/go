  The Go Programming Language
  Package testing provides support for automated testing of Go packages.  It is
  intended to be used in concert with the "go test" command, which automates
  execution of any function of the form
      func TestXxx(*testing.T)
  where Xxx can be any alphanumeric string (but the first letter must not be in
  [a-z]) and serves to identify the test routine.
