Packages


Underscore _ syntax
===================
package main
import (
  "database/sql"
  "fmt"
  _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
  "log"
)

...

You can note this through the underscore _ syntax that precedes the packages
import. You're likely already familiar with this as a quick-and-dirty way to
ignore the instantiation of a returned value from a method. For example x,
_ := something() allows you to ignore the second returned value.

It's also often used when a developer plans to use a library, but hasn't yet. By
prepending the package this way, it allows the import declaration to stay without
causing a compiler error. While this is frowned upon, the use of the underscore - or
blank identifier - in the preceding method, for side effects, is fairly common and
often acceptable.
