      Notice the : before the = and that no type was
      specified. The type is not necessary because the
      Go compiler is able to infer the type based on
      the literal value you assign the variable.
      ...
      Generally you should use this shorter form whenever
      possible.

       Can I stop these complaints about my unused variable/import?
       The presence of an unused variable may indicate a bug, while unused
       imports just slow down compilation, an effect that can become
       substantial as a program accumulates code and programmers over time.
       For these reasons, Go refuses to compile programs with unused variables
       or imports, trading short-term convenience for long-term build speed and
       program clarity.
