Package log


Package log implements a simple logging package.  It defines a type, Logger,
with methods for formatting output.  It also has a predefined 'standard'
Logger accessible through helper functions Print[f|ln], Fatal[f|ln], and
Panic[f|ln], which are easier to use than creating a Logger manually.  That
logger writes to standard error and prints the date and time of each logged
message.  The Fatal functions call os.Exit(1) after writing the log message.
The Panic functions call panic after writing the log message.
