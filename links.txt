Package testing
import "testing"
The Go Programming Language
Package testing provides support for automated testing of Go packages.  It is
intended to be used in concert with the "go test" command, which automates
execution of any function of the form
    func TestXxx(*testing.T)
where Xxx can be any alphanumeric string (but the first letter must not be in
[a-z]) and serves to identify the test routine.
