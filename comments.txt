Comments

Comments serve as program documentation.  There are two forms:

1. Line comments start with the character sequence // and stop at the end of
   the line.

2. General comments start with the character sequence /* and stop with the
  first subsequent character sequence */.

A comment cannot start inside a rune[1] or string literal[2], or inside a
comment.  A general comment containing no newlines acts like a space.  Any
other comment acts like a newline.
