Usage


Go MySQL Driver is an implementation of Go's database/sql/driver interface.
You only need to import the driver and can use the full database/sql API then.

Use mysql as driverName and a valid DSN as dataSourceName:

import "database/sql"
import _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"

db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")
