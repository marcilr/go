floating point
  float32
  float64
  complex64
  complex128

Go has two floating point types: float32 and float64
(also often referred to as single precision and double
precision respectively) as well as two additional types
for representing complex numbers (numbers with
imaginary parts): complex64 and complex128 . Generally
we should stick with float64 when working with float-
ing point numbers.
