Integer types

uint8 , uint16 , uint32 , uint64,
int8 , int16 , int32 and int64.

uint - Unsigned integer


There are also 3 machine dependent integer types:
  uint, int and uintptr

They are machine dependent because their size depends on the type of
architecture you are using.

Generally if you are working with integers you should just use the int type.
