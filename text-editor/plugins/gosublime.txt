GoSublime


The Sublime Text editor with the Gosublime plugin is great for go development.
Fine color syntax highlighting and build environment.


Installation
============
1. In Sublime Text determine the Packages directory:
Preferences > Browse Packages...
/home/marcilr/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/

2. Change to Packages directory and clone GoSublime:
$ cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/
$ git clone https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime

3. Copy ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/GoSublime/GoSublime.sublime-settings
to ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User and edit it to your liking.
NOTE: I did not do this last step and GoSublime works fine.
