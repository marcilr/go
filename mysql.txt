MySQL access from go


Two fast and reliable drivers are available for MySQL :

o MyMySQL
  http://github.com/ziutek/mymysql

o Go-MySQL-Driver
  https://github.com/Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL/

I've used both of them in production, programs are running for months with
connection numbers in the millions without failure.
